# The eSaran API Overview #

The eSaran API is designed so that programmers can build their own wrappers for programs for submitting to remote HPC resources. There are a few ways to use the API, each of which can be used exclusively or mixed to get the desired results. We discuss these, the important data structures, and some of the utility functions of the API in the following pages:

  * [Common Options](eSaranCommonOptions.md)
  * [Data structures](eSaranDataStructures.md)
  * [Procedural-based wrappers](eSaranProceduralWrappers.md)
  * [Callback-based wrappers](eSaranCallbackWrappers.md)
  * [XML-based wrappers](eSaranXMLwrappers.md)
