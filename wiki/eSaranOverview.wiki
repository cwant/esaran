#summary Overview of eSaran
= eSaran =

The eSaran project strives to make high performance computing (HPC) accessible to researchers who may not have a computational background.

This is achieved in two ways:

1) By providing a series of wrappers for popular HPC programs that the user can run on their local machine to make the network and queuing system more transparent;

2) By providing an API that programmers can use to easily make their own wrappers for submitting jobs.

This wiki aims to document these two parts
